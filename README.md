# Tic-tac-toe (C++17 / SDL2)

This repository contains source code for a classic Tic-tac-toe game which is implemented using C++17 and SDL2. 

The purpose of this project was just to learn more about C++17 / SDL2, and therefore, most likely contain several mistakes and bad practices. However, I decided to upload the project in github anyway in case someone sees it useful in some form or another. Hence, there is also text-based version of the same game in a [separate branch](https://github.com/maunovaha/CppTicTacToe/tree/text-based).

### *Note*

This project is still pretty much "under construction" until I finish adding audio support to the game and make some refactoring. However, atm. I am relatively busy doing something else.

## How to compile and run

### Windows

Open the *CppTicTacToe.sln* file in *Microsoft Visual Studio*, and hit *F5* to run it. (Just make sure *x86* is selected for targeting platform).

### macOS

```
make main
./bin/CppTicTacToe
```
